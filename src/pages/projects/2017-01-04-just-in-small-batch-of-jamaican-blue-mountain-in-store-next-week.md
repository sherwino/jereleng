## Drafter with P.E. Experience

This trellis was made for an area with high wind loads and strict calculation regulations. The design for this trellis was critical for integrity but still being easy to install. The initial design were taken to a P.E. for calculations and only minor corrections were needed. This is what happens when shop drawings are done by an experienced drafter.
